I hacked this together in a weekend for Olin College's end-of-semester Expo. It uses the carriage of an HP Photosmart printer, replacing the printhead with a servo holding a sharpie. An AVR microcontroller uses PID to position the pen and paper.

A boarding pass printed by this printer was rejected by the TSA.
